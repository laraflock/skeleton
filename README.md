> __NOTE:__ Replace `:author_twitter` `:author_name` `:author_email` `:license_holder` `:package_name` `:package_namespace` `:package_description` `:vendor_name` `:vendor_namespace` `:website` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [composer.json](composer.json) files. Also update the `Vendor Namespace` and `Package Namespace` in `src/Providers/ServiceProvider.php` and `tests/TestCase.php` then delete this line.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
